"""Environment variable used to convey the Keystone auth context.

Auth context is essentially the user credential used for policy enforcement.
It is a dictionary with the following attributes:

* ``user_id``: user ID of the principal
* ``project_id`` (optional): project ID of the scoped project if auth is
                             project-scoped
* ``domain_id`` (optional): domain ID of the scoped domain if auth is
                            domain-scoped
* ``roles`` (optional): list of role names for the given scope
* ``group_ids``: list of group IDs for which the API user has membership
